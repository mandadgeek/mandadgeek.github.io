<p>So I've been playing Fallout 4 lately. Surprise surprise. I don't get a crazy amount of time to play but I will seriously sneak in any opportunity to get in a little bit of time. ANY opportunity. My wife decides to scoop ice cream during our night time shows, I'm playing Fallout. I have a little time before taking out the dogs, I'm playing Fallout. I wake up a few minutes before my alarm goes off, I'm playing Fallout. I feel a long deuce session coming, I'm grabbing my Vita and I'm playing Fallout.<!--more-->
<br><br>
At this point, I can't remember how many hours I've managed to put in but I think I just crossed the Level 16 threshhold. I've barely done a single story mission, which I think I'm going to change soon. There's just so much to do already and I know that I've barely scratched the surface. I'm also trying my level best not to read too much or watch too much about the game. As you'll come to know, I despise spoilers. For Fallout though, there's something so awesome about going back to a world that is so familiar yet so new all at once. It's the same Fallout environment that I know from Fallout 3 but I know that at any given moment I could come across something completely new. Plus, the way that I get to experience the world is a bit different this time around and I'm enjoying the changes. At this point, the only thing I do dare to look up are some specific tips about certain things like crafting and settlement building. I've definitely taken time to explore the systems and started experimenting and poking around in them but I also don't want to know if there are some serious missteps that I should be avoiding, lest I end up wasting my precious and limited time. So far so good though. I don't seem to have made any major errors, yet. I'm a big fan of playing through a game as much as possible without reading up on too many tips and tricks, at least when it comes to min maxing gear and stuff. I don't want someone to tell me which weapons are practically useless. If I want a weapon, I want to find a way to make it work for my playstyle. Is it efficient? Probably not. I'm sure I'll end up taking severely underpowered equipment into some fights. But, it makes for a good story when I come out on the other side . For me, making a gameplay experience my own is important. I don't always want to know the absolutely best weapon or equipment in a game. Thankfully, Fallout 4 gives you plenty of opportunities to write your own tales from the wasteland.

As much as I want to get other games this season like Black Ops 3 and Battlefront, I'll be hard pressed to find the time to enjoy those games when the Wasteland's eery song is constantly calling me back. Oh yeah, and I have a son to find :P
