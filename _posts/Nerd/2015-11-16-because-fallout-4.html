<p>At this year's family Christmas dinner, one simple comment put us onto a path of theories that we think could (or should) explain Rey's background and lay the groundwork for episodes VIII and IX. The comment: "What if Rey's parents were bad?" Major spoilers ahead, turn back now if you need to. Otherwise, <!--more-->
<br><br>
It would have been easy to simply dismiss the comment but we entertained the idea just long enough to string together some plot lines that I think are pretty strong and would love to see fleshed out on the big screen.
<br><br>
Up to this point, most fans have been wrestling with the debate about who Rey's parents are. The likely candidates are Han and Leia, Luke and an unidentified woman, or a couple that has yet to be identified. Maybe the parents haven't been identified yet, but maybe they're not the good force sensitive parents we may have assumed to this point. What if Rey's parents were on the dark side?
<br><br>
If that's true, how does she end up with Luke? We think that mayb, Rey's force sensitive parents were somehow involved with the Knights of Ren. We don't know much at all about them yet so we don't know of Kylo started them or has ascended to the leadership position of the Knights. Either way, we figure her parents were somehow involved and that's how Kylo has knowledge about her existence. Kylo knew her parents and knew they had a child that could be very powerful with the force. But how did they get separated?
<br><br>
We didn't come up with a final version of these events but it goes a little something like this. During Kylo's betrayal, Luke is left facing off with Kylo and his Knights while everyone else has been slain. During the epic showdown, Luke strikes down Rey's parents. Or, an alternative version is that he encounters then in a more private encounter where their daughter may have been nearby. Maybe he's hunting down the Knights or something along those lines. After striking down the parents, Luke cannot bring himself to strike down a child, especially one in whom the force is powerful. He decides to take her away and use his Jedi powers to convince her that he is her family now and proceeds to leave her on Jakku with trusted friends that know how to keep secrets. He promises he will return and that becomes her memory of the events that left her on Jakku.
<br><br>
We felt that this revelation could lead to what we think is a necessary internal conflict that Rey must face as the lead protagonist. Somewhere maybe towards the end of episode VIII, the truth is revealed to Rey, presumably during an encounter with Kylo and/or Snoke in an attempt to sway her away from her teach Luke and over to the dark side. Learning of her parent's death, Rey becomes torn and doesn't know how to feel towards Luke and what he's done, especially after lying to her about her parent's and his connection to her. The doll, the helmet, all part of a lie to reinforce her connection with him.
<br><br>
Here's where it gets even more crazy. Their attempts to sway Rey succeed!! How mind blowing would it be if they flipped the protagonist completely and she turns to the dark side at the end of Episode VIII? We're talking about the kind of reveal we had in Episode V when we learn the truth about Vader and Luke. We also think this would be a PRIME opportunity to turn everything on its head as we watch Rey make her final turn to the dark as she's striking down Luke to avenge her fallen parents.
