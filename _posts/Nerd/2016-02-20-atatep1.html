<p>Chris and I are so very excited to finally drop our first NRDPLS "All Teh Awesome Thing" aka The AT-AT show ep. 1 video! This is our maiden voyage as YT content creators, and what better intro than talking about who we are, our love for snowboarding and the recent games we've been hooked on!
<br><br>
Sorry for the lengthiness of it, but we had to do it big for the first one. Thanks for watching! All links in the description below the video

Stay Nerdy, my friends :)
