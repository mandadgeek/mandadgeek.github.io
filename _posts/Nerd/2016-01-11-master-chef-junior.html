<p>I enjoy cooking. I'm not a great cook but I can hold my own in a kitchen if I have to. I have a few personal recipes that have been hits and I can usually replicate something with enough instruction. I loved watching Chopped for the longest time and still do, but this gem of a show has really captured me along with my wife and her family. If you haven't taken the opportunity to check it out, I really think you should sit down with your people, especially if you have young kids, and give this one a go.<!--more-->
<br><br>
The show follows a cooking competition between young up and coming cooks from the ages of 8 to 12. When you see what these kids can cook it's just astounding. I didn't do anything of the sort when I was that age and even the show's judges, Gorden Ramsey, Graham Elliot, and Christina Tosi (Joe Bastianich in seasons 1-3), comment that none of them had the culinary skills these kids exhibit until later in life. They are simply amazing.

There's no denying the cute factor as these kids are still obviously kids at heart. Each episode opens with a challenge which gives the winner(s) an advantage over the elimination competition that follows. The challenges are fun, but still very challenging, and it's easy to see that the judges are having just as much fun watching and encouraging the kids as they're working their butts off trying to put together a winning dish. It's heartbreaking to see your favorites get eliminated (who doesn't get choked up when a child is crying their eyes out on national television?) but they always walk away knowing there's so much more to learn and limitless potential to their growth. We all as viewers know this too because as I said, you cannot deny the skill with which these children cook.
<br><br>
Aside from all of those things though, what I really appreciate about the show is that there are so many lessons to be learned about life. Gordon Ramsey is notorious for being a hard-ass but in this show you see a much softer side of him, but don't lose the high expectations in the process. He is like an encouraging and understanding father that has high expectations for his children because he knows and believes in their talent and ability. There are so many great teaching moments where you see the judges inform, educate, nurture, and challenge the children to think, be aware, and improve their skills and their mental process. Don't get me wrong, the judges do not pull any punches. When there's harsh criticism to be doled out they don't shy away from it. But, they also understand that these are young, extremely talented, impressionable people that are the future of the industry that they have built their lives around. This is an opportunity to refine, teach, and nurture.
<br><br>
These kids are just incredible. So much skill and knowledge at such a young age. I was probably making toast with butter and sugar and impressing myself with that. They encounter some crazy challenges, humongous setbacks, nervous breakdowns, bruised friendships, and so much more, but they show the resiliency and determination of a young, inspired minds, that are filled with dreams. At this point in their lives, everything is possible because they haven't learned how to limit themselves like some of us older folk have. It's inspiring and fun, heartfelt and intense, so many things wrapped into one great show that I think deserves some of your TV time.
