This week the Division launched their big April update that included their new end game content, Incursions. At the end of last week, I had just reached level 30 and was starting to grind up my Dark Zone rank and nearly made it to 30 when I suddenly hit a wall. Did I really want to do this grind? After getting ganked several times and not quite making rank 30 I quickly decided that I had enjoyed my time with the Division but it was probably time to move on. I'm so glad I did.
<br><br>
To replace my gaming time before blockbusters like Uncharted 4 and No Man's Sky come out in the upcoming months, I got back to Salt and Sanctuary. I had started into it just a little several weeks ago and wanted to play the whole game through in co-op but figured that would be a tall order. I just couldn't wait any longer. I dove in and I am not coming up for air.
<br><br>
Salt and Sanctuary was developed and published by Ska Studios. They've made over a dozen different games, many of which I have never heard of, but this game was immediately on my radar when I learned about it. It was called the 2D version of Dark Souls, how could I not pay attention to it?
<br><br>
Let's get into the nuts and bolts. Salt and Santuary is a 2D action/platforming/rpg game that reminds me a lot of Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. The world is an open-ish world where you are free to go wherever you like but the more difficult areas are generally going to be blocked off with gates or geography that you won't be able to get past without defeating certain bosses first. But, you can and will go back and forth through the different areas many times over whether for grinding out levels and items or to explore new areas that may have opened up to you. I chose the Hunter class as my starting class which uses whips as a primary weapon so that's also why it feels a lot like Castlevania right now.
<br><br>
The game is unabashedly like Dark Souls/Bloodborne and Ska Studios doesn't even try to mask the fact that they've drawn an incredible amount of inspiration from that genaeology of games. In my opinion, that's a great thing. You have several different classes to choose from along with a bevy of weapons, armor, and items. You're not locked into your initial class choice as the skill tree allows you to branch off into any other class/weapon category you can reach with your allotment of skill points. You also have a limited opportunities to respec your choices. The weapons provide a decent amount of variability in combat. It's not a supremely deep combat system but you can tell that each weapon type has a unique move set, reach, speed, etc. So much so that I'm already thinking about playing through the game again trying out the other weapons that I haven't gotten around to trying yet. You can use any class 0 weapon too so you can try them out as you get them and decide if you like a particular style of combat and then pursue that. As I mentioned, I started with the Hunter and they use whips and crossbows initially. I've come to really love the daggers so I started spending some points in the Assassin class instead of improving my crossbow skills. On top of all that, you can have two weapon loadouts that you can actively switch between by pressing L1. And, you can choose to use weapons with one or two hands. If you're not going two-handed, you can put a shield or secondary weapon (or torch) in your other hand for even more variability.

The enemies are lethal. Even when you're leveled above the standard array of enemies, if you take them too casually or ignore them, they can and will still kill you most of the time. The bosses so far have been a nice combination of challenge and creativity. I've beaten a handful so far and there's only one that I managed to go in and kill on my first shot. The others took a series of learning and adjusting, dying, learning, dying, dying, dying, you know the drill. Combat is pretty fast paced most of the time, which is why I included the Bloodborn reference as well. You can roll to dodge or roll through enemies when they are attacking if your timing is good enough. You have the option of swording and boarding if that's what you prefer, just watch your stamina guage. In many cases, it's wise to employ both. It doesn't take many hits for a boss to take you down so be prepared with your healing potions and try to find a window of opportunity to down one when you get the chance.
<br><br>
Also like the Souls games, Salt and Sanctuary doesn't really explain anything to you. The menus could certainly use a few optimization tweaks and changes (I sometimes wonder how playtesters didn't manage to include some of the most simple QOL changes that I immediately think of for menus and such) but that's just something you learn to deal with in games like this. Honestly, I'm not sure why it's not done better. Somewhat clunky menu aside, you should eventually learn to navigate the game pretty well. Unfortunately, that doesn't do much to alleviate the mystery of what everything is and how you do certain things. I don't usually like to read things online because I prefer to enjoy games as much as I can on my own as I would naturally play them but for this game, I would definitely recommend reading up on some things like the Creeds.
<br><br>
I am really enjoying my time with Salt and Sanctuary and am already looking forward to future playthroughs with different weapons and hopefully some coop too. I might even make a separate character just for coop so Tim and I can start pretty fresh with that. The game is currently out for PS4 and will be coming to the Vita and PC sometime in the future. I highly highly recommend you give it a shot. We can trade our best death/victory stories!

Stay NRDy my friends.
