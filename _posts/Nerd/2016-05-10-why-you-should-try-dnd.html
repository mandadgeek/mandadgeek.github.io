I often imagine myself as a super fantastical badass of one kind or another, whether it be as an ace space mecha pilot, a shapechanging rogue, a promiscuous singing bard, or a mutated porcupine. I have one of those imaginations that can easily get away from, for better or for worse. I won't watch most scary movies because of it. A blessing and a curse I would say. But, I enjoy imaging what I might do in a crazy scenario from a movie or an anime. How would I fare against an army of orcs and goblins? Would I charge courageously into an enemy mother ship when all else seems lost? How many fools would I kill in a whirlind of katana steel? It's easy enough to sit around by my onesy and go through these scenarios but it doesn't quite give the same satisfaction as one of my first NRDy loves, the table-top role playing game.<!--more-->

I blame my brother for introducing my to Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) back during a time when people thought it was an evil product of Satan. I suppose I can understand that. Before fantasy and sci-fi were so common and widespread, having a stack of books with demons, monsters,  and such doesn't really look like favorable reading material. My brother persisted and I remember watching him and his friends play a few games in our little home and visualizing everything that was going on. It was all so fun and exciting.
<br><br>
Not long after that, I was able to collect books of my own and I had a close circle of friends that were just as NRDy and imaginitive as I was. Soon we were sitting around on the floor with stacks upon stacks of books and we'd just spend hours adventuring the days away. It's intimidating, I know. It can be VERY overwhelming too if you're not getting your feet wet with a starter set of some kind. Diving into a 300+ page book of rules and information doesn't usually translate to fun. But trust me, NRDs, especially NRDs that love video game rpgs, you might want to take the opportunity to find yourself a group and try out DnD or some other form of table-top role playing game. It's a time investment, for sure, but I believe it is completely worthwhile.

Despite the experience being wrapped in rules and books and dice, a DnD (and other table-top role playing games. I'm just going to say DnD to encompass all of them because I don't want to keep typing this) session really boils down to a handful of friends hanging out, enjoying each other's company, and telling a story together. Players bring their characters, the Dungeon Master (DM), who runs the game and plays all of the other characters including the villains, brings the rest. The story begins and what happens from there, only your collective imagination and the rolls of the dice will tell. Players have the ability to say and do whatever they want, within reason of course, so there's no telling what's going to happen once the game gets underway. It is then the DM's job to respond and determine how the world responds to what the characters do. All of the rules that are there are just there to provide some form of groundedness to the game. The story and the characters all exist within a world, albeit a fictitious one, but that world needs a set of rules to govern it and each world is different from the next, meaning each table-top game is played in it's own unique setting. DnD is one of if not the oldest of the table-top games, at least to my knowledge, so its world is very fleshed out and vast, not only through the RPG books but also through novels, video games, and even movies. But, not all table-top games are high fantasy games. I've played Macross and Robotech for your space opera action. I've played TMNT, RIFTs for a blend of fantasy and sci-fi, I've played Legend of the 5 Rings for a taste of fantasy feudal Japan, Eberron for a fantasy/magical/team punk combination, and there are so many more. Table-top role playing games literally provide limitless possibilities for fun and adventure.

If you're a newcomer, I will caution you. If you're able to find a group that you can go to, try to be as open minded as you can be and do your best to be engaged with what's going on. Role playing groups come in many different shapes and sizes. Some players will get super into character and only talk in their character's voice, use accents, and speak like they just walked out of a Shakespearean play. Others will be more of a balanced blend of in-character and out of character talking. Just know that you might want into a super NRD group that goes all out when it's time to game. Each DM is different as well and as each person has their own strengths and weaknesses, DMs run their games in many different ways too. Your first experience may be hit or miss to be honest, which is unfortunate, but try to find a welcoming group that has a nice mix of some new people and veteran players that can help guide the newer players. The more willing you are to just let your inhibitions go and just NRD out, the more likely you are to have a fun experience. There are a lot of rules but the veterans and the DM should help you through them. Be imaginitive, be creative, be engaged, and the world of table-top rpgs can bring a wealth of fun nights and unforgettable adventures into your life.

Tim and I are playing through a DnD game now that I'm DMing and after our first session, so far so good. I'm sure we'll be talking about it more as the adventure goes on. The table-top role playing game is a step deeper into the NRD realm for most people, but don't let that dissuade you. It's a fun and exciting realm to be in if you can find yourself a good group of players to adventure with and a DM to guide you. If you do get a chance to try it out, let us know about your thoughts and your experiences. We'd love to hear about your adventures!

Stay NRDy my friends.
