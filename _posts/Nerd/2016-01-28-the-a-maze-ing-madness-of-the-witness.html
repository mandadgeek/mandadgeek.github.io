<p>This week, Thekla, Inc., directed by Jonathan Blow (creator of Braid), released its long anticipated game, The Witness, on PC and PS4. I believe it's eventually coming to iOS as well.
<br><br>
I picked the game up immediately and started digging into its mysterious island awesomeness. You have no idea who you are or why you're on this island. All that you know is that there are puzzles upon puzzles to solve in the hope of finding some answers to, well, all teh questions.
<br><br>
The puzzles are all puzzles on what seem to be electrical panels that are interconnected through wires that power and trigger devices or more panels for you to solve. The simplistic goal of each puzzle is to successfully draw a line from a starting point on the grid to a specified end point. It all starts out easily enough but the puzzles get increasingly more difficult to understand. You start seeing symbols on the grid, each of which means something different. There will be environmental factors that come into play, different perspectives, all kinds of different and creative ways to determine which route on the grid is the right one. As of this writing, I'm maybe half a dozen hours into the game and so far I've been pretty successful at figuring out many of the puzzles I've found on the island. However, there are definitely some that I encounter that look so complex that I simply turnaround and venture off to another part of the island.
<br><br>
Did I mention that it's sort of open world? You're free to roam the island as you choose. There's no traditional story, no guiding narrative. You open a door and then it's just you and the island, and the puzzles. At least, that's what I know so far. I won't spoil anything for you either, I hate that. The island is just gorgeous. Vibrant colors and varying environments are all waiting to be discovered and it seems like you may never really know why all of it is the way that it is. The thought of possibly finding out is so intriguing and engaging.
<br><br>
There are no instructions for any of the puzzles. You simply find a panel and try your best to figure it out. The nice thing is that you will usually find a series of puzzles that are set up to teach you what a particular symbol means. Again, there are no instructions so you typically find yourself doing a lot of trial and error until you've managed to sort out exactly what a symbol is trying to tell you. It's like learning a language, seriously. After learning a few of the symbols my confidence rose and I started quickly making my way through a particular section of the island and then bam! A new symbol appears and I'm stopped in my tracks. When you're presented with multiple symbols on a large grid and there is one or maybe more than one component that you don't understand, you don't stand a chance. Even if you were to guess and get it right, it doesn't really help you in the long run. Your goal is to understand the language and use it to unlock the secrets of the island.
<br><br>
The game can be extremely frustrated at times because you simply don't understand how to get past a puzzle but the moment you figure it out it's one of the most exhilarating and empowering feelings you may ever have. The last time I can remember feeling so accomplished while playing a game was when I was playing Bloodborne and finally beat a boss that was having her way with me for days. That's saying a lot for a "simple" puzzle game.
<br><br>
If you love mind games, brain teasers, intellectual challenges, and don't mind spending plenty of time pondering over a puzzle, you should do yourself a favor and pick up The Witness.
