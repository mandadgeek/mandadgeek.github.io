<p>This week, Thekla, Inc., directed by Jonathan Blow (creator of Braid), released its long anticipated game, The Witness, on PC and PS4. I believe it's eventually coming to iOS as well.
<br><br>
I picked the game up immediately and started digging into its mysterious island awesomeness. You have no idea who you are or why you're on this island. All that you know is that you are given puzzle upon puzzle to figure out in the hopes of finding some answers to, well, all teh questions.
<br><br>
The puzzles are all 2D puzzles on what seem to be electrical panels. The simplistic goal of each puzzle is to successfully draw a line from a starting point on the grid to a specified end point. It all starts out easily enough but the puzzles get increasingly more difficult to understand. You start seeing symbols on the grid, each of which means something different. There will be environmental factors that come into play, different perspectives, all kinds of different and creative ways to determine which route on the grid is the right one. As of this writing, I'm maybe half a dozen hours into the game and so far I've been pretty successful at figuring out many of the puzzles I've found on the island. However, there are definitely some that I encounter that look so complex that I simply turnaround and venture off to another part of the island.
<br><br>
Did I mention that it's sort of open world? You're free to roam the island as you choose. There's no traditional story, no guiding narrative, you open a door and then it's just you and the island, and the puzzles. At least, that's what I know so far. I won't spoil anything for you either, I simply hate that. Back to roaming the island. It's simply gorgeous. Vibrant colors and varying environments are all waiting to be discovered and it seems like you may never really know why all of it is the way that it is. The thought of possibly finding out is so intriguing and engaging.
