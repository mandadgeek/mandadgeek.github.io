Quick updates! I'm pretty sure that I will not be able to put together a playlist for September, and quite possibly October. With our first little girl on the way any day now, I may not have time for anything for the next few months lol. But, there is a little something I'd like to say before I end up taking a probable hiatus from posting. Please read ahead.

Frances will probably hate me for posting that picture of her but it's one of my most favorite pictures of her. I think she's just beautiful in it and it captures her fun and goofy self too. Over the past nine months, I've watched her carry our little growing baby girl with so much grace. Other fathers and husbands ask me about how bad things get during the pregnancy but everytime I stop to think about it, it honestly hasn't been that bad at all. I can't imagine what it's like to carry a baby to term, but I'm glad that I get to experience it with Frances.

To say that it's been a difficult couple of weeks would be a big understatement; but, through the grace of God, things seem to have worked out pretty well so far. A few weeks ago I wrote about re-prioritizing my life and I had no clue that it would be put to the test so soon and so harshly, but it was. I won't go into the details, but suffice it to say that I think after everything has been said and done, Frances and I, are much stronger for the struggle, as is everyone else involved. To say that I love my family, immediate and extended, would also be a big understatement. God's plans are mysterious indeed, but they are always good in the end.

I'll do my best to keep this from turning into a baby blog once our little girl arrives hahaha. No promises though. I still hope to write and record some content with Tim whenever we're able. Hopefully as things settle down we'll be able to sit down and talk more about life and other nerdy things. Until then though, thanks for all of the love and support everyone!

Thanks for reading and as always, stay NRDy!
