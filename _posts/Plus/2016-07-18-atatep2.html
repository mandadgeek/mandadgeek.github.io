<p>Hey nerds! We're back with episode 2 of All Teh Awesome Things where our friend Ian joined us for discussions about soccer, gun control, a little anime, and even stem cells. We're all over the place!
<br><br>
This one would have been up sooner but YouTube didn't like the first song we chose. No worries though, we'll be at it more frequently as we refine the AT-AT show and Console-Tations in the near future. Thanks for watching! All links and information about the background music are in the description below the video.
<br><br>
Stay Nerdy, my friends :)
