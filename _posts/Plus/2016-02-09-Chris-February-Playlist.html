Every month I try to put together a new playlist on Soundcloud to give you a sense of the kind of music that moves me. This month, Feb. 2016, I'm feeling the disco vibe like never before. I would also like to make this a small tribute to the recently deceased Maurice White, co-founder of the timeless seminal band Earth, Wind and Fire, one of my all-time favorite bands. RIP Maurice, and thank you for the band and the music that shaped my childhood.
