I've had a good life. A great life actually. My life has always been full of good people and good memories. Life changing influences. Impactful moments.<!--more-->
<br><br>
I'm not the most exciting, or even interesting person by a long shot. But, after being alive for 35 years I'm very happy with what I've done with what life has thrown my way and I feel incredibly blessed with what I've been given.
<br><br>
I know I called this a reflection post but it's more like a projection post. I don't want to spend as much time thinking about where I've been as I do with looking ahead to what's coming and where I'm going.
<br><br>
I'm a praying man and this morning I was having a conversation with God, being thankful for all of the things that are and have been a part of my life. Then I started asking, "what kind of man did you intend for me to be?" I immediately remembered something that stuck out to me during our Pre Cana classes before our wedding. They're classes that all Catholic couples have to take as part of their marriage preparation. The priest told us men that our primary responsibility as husbands is to ensure that we and our families make it to Heaven. It's a simple statement, but wow is that a lot of responsibility. It's also a lot of purpose.
<br><br>
I would like that purpose to be the driving influence for my choices in this, my 36th year of being alive. I am a husband first and foremost now and my goal is to live that way. I need to start working down my life's priorities and making sure they're all in order from top to bottom.
<br><br>
- Faith<br>
- Family<br>
- Friends
<br><br>
I've come to understand that it's most important for me to ensure that I'm personally good before I go off and try taking care of someone else. Put on your air pressure mask first, then others, that whole thing. I also learned that the better I am and the more valuable I am, the more I am able to give out and the more valuable I am to those around me. So, faith first, my relationship with God. Then, my relationship with my wife and my immediate family. After that, my dear friends.
<br><br>
It's going to be a good year. I know that challenges will come but challenges and changes are opportunities for growth. Good times will come and we will celebrate them with gusto. God willing, our little family of four (the two dogs Kikko and Korree of course) will grow to more than that. When it does, I intend to be the man, husband, and father I am called to be. That's a somewhat different man than I was a few years ago but I'm not looking back, I like to keep my eyes forward.
<br><br>
Thank you to everyone that has sent birthday wishes, you all rock my world :D My life wouldn't have been the same without all of your influences on it and I'm ecstatic to see where we go from here.
