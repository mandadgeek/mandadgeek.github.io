"Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth." -Marcus Aurelius? (under debate)<!--more-->
<br><br>
There's some debate over the real origination of the quote above. I'm not hear to talk about that though. I do; however, want to talk about perspective. I try my level best to stay aware of other perspectives for even though no single perspective is the absolute truth, it is someone's truth and that's an important differentiation to understand.
<br><br>
We see the world through a unique pair of lenses that colors everything that we look upon. My perspective is singular in the history of humanity. No one that has ever existed and no one to come will ever see the world exactly as I see it. I don't share the exact same combination of history, memories, experiences, lessons, family, friends, influences, joys, woes, decisions, successes, failures, beliefs, values, morals, etc. as anyone else, period. Despite knowing that, I still find myself thinking that how I think or the way I see things should apply to eeeeveryone else that I encounter. I'm a choleric, what can I say.
<br><br>
This is a poor way of going through life in my experience. While I'm not saying we should strive to agree with other people's opinions and perspectives, I think it's a very worthwhile effort to try and understand other perspectives and points of view. It's the reason why all of those asian insurance commercials are so effective at tugging at our heart strings. We think we know the truth about a situation and then we are presented a new perspective and immediately our feelings change.
<br><br>
I would like that purpose to be the driving influence for my choices in this, my 36th year of being alive. I am a husband first and foremost now and my goal is to live that way. I need to start working down my life's priorities and making sure they're all in order from top to bottom.
<br><br>
- Faith<br>
- Family<br>
- Friends
<br><br>
I've come to understand that it's most important for me to ensure that I'm personally good before I go off and try taking care of someone else. Put on your air pressure mask first, then others, that whole thing. I also learned that the better I am and the more valuable I am, the more I am able to give out and the more valuable I am to those around me. So, faith first, my relationship with God. Then, my relationship with my wife and my immediate family. After that, my dear friends.
<br><br>
It's going to be a good year. I know that challenges will come but challenges and changes are opportunities for growth. Good times will come and we will celebrate them with gusto. God willing, our little family of four (the two dogs Kikko and Korree of course) will grow to more than that. When it does, I intend to be the man, husband, and father I am called to be. That's a somewhat different man than I was a few years ago but I'm not looking back, I like to keep my eyes forward.

Thank you to everyone that has sent birthday wishes, you all rock my world :D My life wouldn't have been the same without all of your influences on it and I'm ecstatic to see where we go from here.
