<p>When I was a young, I played video games all the time. I watched cartoons, played with toys, you know, all the typical things a boy might be expected to do. As I got older and got into college and life's responsibilities started to settle on me, I got involved with lots of other hobbies and passions and continued with my enjoyment of games of all kinds. All the while, I didn't take care of my health. I would have laughed you out of the room if you asked me to exercise on a regular basis and eat well.

A few years and a few health scares later, my tune had changed. I turned into someone that couldn't be bothered with video games and became a health and fitness fanatic. I took a journey of self improvement. My efforts to fix my body inevitably lead me to learning that in order to do that, I had to fix my mind. I took up the study of personal development and leadership coaching and became an outspoken person that always had something of value to share. It was an interesting turning point for someone as quiet as I am naturally inclined to be. I was nowhere near the person I was a handful of years prior to that. I was in very good shape, always sharpening my mind and giving out as much as I could take in.

Fast forward to today, another handful of years later. Here I am, writing to you. I'm out of shape, I love playing video games, I haven't read anything to grow myself in some time. But, I'm married to the most wonderful person I've ever met and have started a life as a husband and we look ahead excitedly to starting a family. Someday soon, God willing, I'll be a father. I have two families now and I can't even begin to tell you how immensely blessed I am to call them both my own and for them to now be able to enjoy each other through our marriage. Life is definitely good.

I've taken up snowboarding, which I'm sure you'll hear about on NRDPLS, and blogging, podcasting, etc. I aim to get back in shape but have a long, steep hill ahead of me. My wife and I will be spending creative time together where we seek and produce, hopefully, inspiring things.

I'm excited for the road ahead. One of my mottoes in life is that the best days are always ahead of you. Otherwise, it's a pretty sad future that awaits you if you don't believe that. I'm at a point of transformation once again. A time that's a little scary and awesome all at the same time. Scary because sometimes I feel like I don't know who I am, but them awesome because I soon realize that I have all of the power to choose who I am from this day forward. Not only do I get to do that like the times before, but I get to do it now with a wife by my side, and double the family behind me (maybe more cause I have a TON of awesome in-laws now). 

So who am I, really? Well, for now, I'm the co-founder of NRDPLS with my brother-in-law Tim. My hope is that through this venture, and through the content that we create, I'll get to really flesh that out and I hope that many of you will be there to help enrich that experience for me while I hope to serve to enrich your life's journey too.</p>
