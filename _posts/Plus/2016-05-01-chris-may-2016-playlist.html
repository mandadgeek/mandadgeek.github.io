It's been a pretty stressful month because I'm moving at home, moving at work, preparing to be a Dad, and preparing to DM my first DnD game in a really long time and I don't want to let my NRDs down. So, when things got crazy, I needed a little something to bring me back down.<!--more-->

My monthly playlists are living playlists so I will continually update them throughout the month with new songs that fit my fancy. You can also check out all of my older playlists on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chrisbatu" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> as well.

Stay NRDy mah friends.</p>
