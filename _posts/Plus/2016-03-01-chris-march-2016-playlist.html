I've been in a pretty chill mood recently so these playlists have served me well. When you're just looking for some background music to go along with your day whether you're on your commute, getting some work done, having some wine, or washing the dishes, the first playlist should fit the bill. If you're looking for something that's still chill but a little more heady with some vocals, check out the bonus playlist and let me know how you like it.<!--more-->

My monthly playlists are living playlists so I will continually update them throughout the month with new songs that fit my fancy. You can also check out all of my older playlists on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chrisbatu" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> as well.

Stay nerdy mah friends.</p>
