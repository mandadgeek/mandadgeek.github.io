It's spring time and I'm not quite ready to jump into the more high energy tracks yet so I'm laying down some groovy house jams for you to enjoy this month. All vocal, all smooth, all groovy, all the time!<!--more-->

My monthly playlists are living playlists so I will continually update them throughout the month with new songs that fit my fancy. You can also check out all of my older playlists on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/chrisbatu" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> as well.

Stay NRDy mah friends.</p>
