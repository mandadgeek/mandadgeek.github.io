Within the span of about a month I will be living in a new home after living in an awesome temporary housing situation for the past few months. And, any day now, I will become a father. I will have a little girl that will depend on Frances and I to give her the best platform that we can, from which we will encourage her to grow up and go out and create a life of her own. Change is coming and it's coming quickly. I'm reminded of a song by Ari Hest with that same title, "Change is Coming," and I've been thinking a lot about how much has already changed and the best way to ensure that the changes ahead also come with progress forward.

Years ago when I was a very dedicated Beachbody Coach, I lived by the motto "always forward."  I had very defined goals for myself and for my team and it was so easy back then to know whether or not my daily activities were driving me ever fowards towards those goals. These days, I don't have such defined goals so it's much more difficult to say. Am I progressing forward? Are all of these changes and decisions facilitating progress, growth, and development? I know for sure that in some regards, such as my health and fitness, the answer is clearly no. But, I then find myself in an internal battle because my health isn't my top priority at the moment, so my goals don't align with it. That line of thought then leads me to think, "then just how important is it really at this stage of my life?"
<br><br>
Just writing this post is getting some mind juices flowing. I do not what's important to me and what I want to focus on in the weeks ahead. I simply need to establish some goals that align with those priorities and start working towards them again. Gradually and consistently. I suppose I'll have a better idea of what's coming when our little girl finally arrives. I hear just about everything goes out the window for a while. I think part of me is reluctant to do anything too seriously at this point, knowing that major changes are coming just down the road.

All I know for sure right now is that I want to be a good husband, a good father, and a good son. I have so much to learn in all those areas so I'm sure that I can find ways to grow and progress. I also know that I will always have a desire to do something to create value for others. I was so passionate about coaching because it was such a clear vehicle for that. I was also passionately involved in my youth group for the same reason. I knew that my involvement and my presence brought value to other people. Heading into fatherhood and being a relatively new husband still, I haven't found my next outlet yet. NRDPLS is a very personal outlet for me at the moment. I get to write and talk about what I want, whether it's something more personal like this or something nerdy, with my brother-in-law, and that's just awesome. Will this ever be valuable to other people? We'll just have to see. I'm excited to find my next outlet though. The next thing that I can pour my passion and talents into. I have a feeling it will align with these next phases of my life. That's another change that I am excitedly anticipating.

New priorities, new goals. I'm going to need to choose a direction soon to start moving "always forward" again, I'm starting to feel a little restless :P

Thanks for reading and as always, stay NRDy!
