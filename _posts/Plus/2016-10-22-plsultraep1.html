<p>Hey nerds! That's right, another day, another show! We think we've finally settled on a set of shows that captures what Chris and I want to be doing. PLS Ultra is our show about the plus side of our lives. In other words, this is the show where we focus on the parts of our lives that are of the not-so-nerdy variety.
<br><br>
Thanks for watching! We're looking forward to getting back into action and maybe working on other special content as well.
<br><br>
Stay NRDy, my friends :)
