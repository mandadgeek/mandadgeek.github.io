Time flies, oh yes it does. Two years ago my wife and I were married on a sunny day in DC. I have so many memories from that day I feel like I could relive it from start to finish. Today, I want to remember those times in this post dedicated to her, God's greatest gift to my life.

Two years ago, all of our planning and preparation had finally come down to one fateful day. Wedding planning can be tremendously stressful and despite the hurdles and road blocks that we ecountered along the way, you were able to put together the most memorable day of our lives with incredible grace and creativity. Not everything was ideal or perfect, but when it came down to it, you and I were getting married and if nothing else went right that day, as long as that held true, then honestly, nothing could have gone wrong. Thankfully for us, I think everything came together pretty well. :)

It was so strange not to see you that morning. To know that so much was going on around us, for us, and because of us, but not get to see it all starting to happening with you by my side. I knew your morning was a lot more crazy than mine. Guys have it so much easier, I have to admit. After helping out with so many other weddings since ours, I always wonder what that morning was like for you. I do regret not making you that "morning of" playlist so that you could know I was there with you in some way. That might be one of the only things I would change from that day lol. I think of you being surrounded by your bridesmaids and parents and getting all prettied up and it makes me so happy to know that you were surrounded by people that love you.

Things were much simpler for me. I got up as usual, took the dogs out for a walk as usual, and got showered and ready as usual. You know me, I'm not one for make-up and hair product :P. After that it was mostly hanging out with my boys, greeting our guests, and making sure that everything else was in order. Doesn't sound all that exciting really but trust me, we were having a good time.

<br>
Then, I got the call. It was time for us to say our personal vows to each other. I came up the your room and was so anxious because I knew you would be so close but I would still have to wait unbearably for a few more hours to see just how beautiful you were that day. I came into the room all cluttered with flower stuff and make-up and saw our photographers and videographers beckoning me in. I walked in, eyes partially closed and stood at the entryway to the bedroom, next to door behind which you were being tucked away and out came your hand. I almost cried already (I'm such a sap, I know). It was the first time I had actually seen you that day, any part of you lol. I reached out and grabbed your hand as we read our vows to each other. I still have the vow I wrote stored on my Keep and I still read it from time to time. I think back to this and remember how ready I was, and still am, to live out our lives together. I remember the promises I made and how my first priority, after being a Son of God, is to be a husband to you. I begrudgingly let go and left your room but I knew that soon, soon, I would finally get to see you walking down that aisle.

The wait felt like forever. My brother and I had to wait up in the the front of the church while the rest of the bridal party was waiting out front for you to arrive. I wish I could have seen everyone's faces as you came walking across the street with your gorgeous gown and bouquet, sun shining so brightly upon you. Instead, I was shaking with excitement and anticipation but had my best-man, my brother, right there with me to keep me together. It reminded me of when I did the same for him on his wedding day, many years ago. I love him to death, you know. I'll cherish those memories forever.

<br>
Finally, we were called out and the wedding party started their entrance. It was time. Our closest family and friends all came down the aisle to support us and witness us administer the sacrement of matrimony, the only sacrament that is administered by two individuals, before God, not by a priest. How beautiful is that?

<br>
And then, there you were. The doors opened and I saw your silhouette. Immediately the tears started to run because that's how real men handle these kinds of things! My brother knew it, so did everyone else. I was a goner. There was no way I wasn't going to cry while I watched you make your way to the altar. So beautiful. The woman I would share the rest of my life with. The partner with whom I will pursue Heaven. The future mother of my children. My one and only.

Father Byrne did a great job. What a blessing it was to have him there for us. I could listen to that man all day lol. I remember thinking how amazing it was to be there for a full mass and have so many of our friends and family there with us to celebrate mass and witness our marriage. I couldn't stop smiling that day. It was finally happening. In less than an hour, you and I were going to be joined forever. After so much planning and anticipation it couldn't happen soon enough. I was never more ready for anything in my life.

I could go on and on about the reception and how much fun that was but that would probably need a post of its own. Maybe I'll start one so everyone can post comments with their favorite memories from that night :) It was all so amazing and so worth every last bit of effort it took for us to put it all together. Not only was it a great memory for us, but it was a joyous memory that our families can now share for the rest of their lives. I was so proud and happy about everything that we had done, but even more so to be side-by-side with you at the end of it all.

You are loved beyond compare. You are such an amazing woman, an even better wife, and will be such an extraordinary mother. I know the Lord blesses all, but I feel like He blessed me the most when He gave me you. I love you so much and I look forward to making new memories like these with you every single day. Happy two-year anniversary my love!

Of course, remembering that day wouldn't be complete without this :)
