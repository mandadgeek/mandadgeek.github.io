"Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth." -Marcus Aurelius? (under debate)<!--more-->
<br><br>
There's some debate over the real origination of the quote above. I'm not here to talk about that though. I do; however, want to talk about perspective. I try my level best to stay aware of other perspectives for even though no single perspective, in the majority of cases, is the absolute truth, it is someone's truth and that's an important differentiation to understand.
<br><br>
We view the world through a unique pair of lenses that colors everything that we see. My perspective is singular in the history of humanity. No one that has ever existed and no one to come will ever see the world exactly as I see it. I don't share the exact same combination of history, memories, experiences, lessons, family, friends, influences, joys, woes, decisions, successes, failures, beliefs, values, morals, etc. as anyone else, period. Neither do you. Despite knowing that, I still find myself thinking that how I think or the way I see things should apply to everyone else. I'm a choleric, what can I say.
<br><br>
This is a poor way of going through life in my experience. While I'm not saying we should strive to agree with other people's opinions and perspectives, I think it's a very worthwhile effort to try and understand other perspectives and points of view. It's the reason why all of those Asian insurance commercials are so effective at tugging at our heart strings. We think we know the truth about a situation and then we are presented a new perspective and immediately our feelings change.
<br><br>
Perspective is the mother of compassion, sympathy, and empathy. It allows us to deeply relate to one another. How many times have we seen or heard of situations and simply can't fathom or understand what is going through the other person's mind? Just the other day, the story of an individual that posed as a doctor and diagnosed patients for thousands of dollars was seen as appaling and worthy of applause. I couldn't understand the latter for the life of me. As I tried to wrap my mind around the thoughts process of someone that lauded his fraudulent deeds, the only thing I was left with was that the applauder was lacking perspective. What if he had been one of the patients that was charged thousands of dollars by a fake doctor for an illness he didn't have? Would he still have the same feelings? I highly doubt it. That experience would alter his lens. His perspective would be different.

Think of all of the art pieces that change because of the angle at which you look at them. There are a ton of great examples <a href="http://smashinghub.com/top-100-amazing-forced-perspective-photography-in-2011.htm" target="_blank">here</a>. From our point of view, artists create an image that looks like one thing but is in reality something completely different. If you were to look at the exact same scene from a different perspective, even as small as a few inches one way or another, it could completely change the resulting image. 
<br><br>
So it goes with life as well. Relationships, conflicts, friendships, social interactions, everything that happens, everything that we encounter and experience has different ways of being viewed. It's actually the reason why we have as many conflicts as we do. It can go a long way in reducing them if we can stretch ourselves a little to try and see things from different perspectives. We can learn to respect each other a little more. We can be more compassionate towards one another. We can see that one story does not tell the whole story. We can see that everything that we see is simply our own perspective and not always, and in fact is rarely ever, the absolute truth.
