 What's going on my fellow NRDs! Welcome to my first ever post on NRDPLS! I know, it took a while, but better late than never! Today, we're gonna take a walk on the PLS side of life. I just recently came back from a hike up in Shenandoah Valley's "Old Rag Mountain", and I have to say, my butt was thoroughly kicked! If any of you from the Northern Virginia area (NoVA) have ever heard about it and are considering trying it out, definitely give it a shot; but heed my warning: this is no casual stroll up a hill! Be prepared to face long inclines, scale rocks, squeeze through and jump over gaps,and climb your way to the summit. I promise you, the view is totally worth it in the end, and you'll leave feeling proud and accomplished; not to mention really, really sore, lol. Let's start at the beginning, shall we?

<br><br>
It all started with my asking on Twitter if any friends wanted to go biking on the weekend, and I got a response from one friend saying he would be down, but he'd have to check if a hike he was previously committed to was still going on. I jokingly invited myself to the hike, and another friend said that I should join them. All of a sudden, the next morning rolled by and BOOM, we all agreed to go hiking. That sure escalated quickly, lol.

<br>
8am was the meeting time, and even after waking up, it wasn't totally clear if the whole group (8 of us total) was going to show. I begrudgingly got up, packed my things, and headed out. Despite the only 4 hours of sleep I got, I was really excited to be out with everyone, especially because I hadn't seen some of them in years. Leave it up to a hike to bring us all together, haha. Sure enough, everyone showed, and it was off to Shenandoah Valley. On the way there, it rained a decent amount, and we were getting worried that it would get worse, if at all stop. We started making jokes about just turning around and going back to sleep; however, the Universe smiled upon us that day, and made sure the weather cleared up by the time we got to the trail. It wasn't completely dry when we reached the beginning of the path to the summit, but it was just enough for us to not turn around and say, "screw this."

It started off easy enough. It was flat-ish from the beginning, and it gradually got steeper as we kept going. The steepness wasnt much of a bother, however it was the terrain that made it tough. I've been on two different hikes in my life; one being The Forest Park Trail in Portland, and the other being Potato Chip Rock in San Diego. They were pretty lengthy and tough, but the terrain was nice and even for the majority of it. Old Rag was not the case. The rocks that paved the way protruded out of the ground at so many different angles and made it a bit more difficult to get a good footing on the path. You were pretty much actively making sure you set your foot down right to keep your momentum up. The path also changed elevation aside from getting steeper as you went along. Imagine an incline that included steps and platforms you had to get over.

<br>
As most physical activities go, the fatigue really starts to gain on you, especially if you're out of shape like I am, lol. I forgot to mention, the hike is a total of 9 miles round trip. For 70% of the way, it's all walking up the mountain, and for the last 30%, well, the real fun begins...
<br><br>
One thing I should note, it's very important to know your limits when doing something like this. You don't want to over do it and cause a serious injury by going at a pace you're not comfortable with. The one thing that definitely saved my behind from getting too tired before the hard part began was going at my own pace. Me and my two other friends decided to do so, and I'm really glad we did. Otherwise, well, I don't think I'd be typing any of this so soon, hahaha. Anyway, after you walk up to a certain point, you get to what's considered the reason this hike is so difficult, and also the most fun: the rock climbing! Now, when I say rock climbing, I'm not talking about what you see at the REI flagship store or at an indoor rock climbing place. I'm talking about Sylvester Stallone, "Cliffhanger" type stuff. The real deal, life or death shit. If you let go or miss a jump, you will be hiking your way to Heaven! . . . Ok, I'm overexaggerating, but it sure as hell seemed that way!

You see that big rock behind my friends? Yeah? Guess what? We didn't climb it, lol.  We did, however, climb around it to the other side. For the most part, that's how it went for the last 30% of the hike to the summit. There were some crazy parts we encountered, like having to press ourselves between two huge boulders and using that position to climb up on top of them, jumping from one side of a rock to the next, grappling and using whatever grooves and naturally made handles the boulders had to get ourselves up, etc. See? Totally "Cliffhanger" worthy! We had no carabiners, rope, anchors, chalk, gloves, and not to mention, the proper footwear for this sort of thing. We straight freehanded the hell out of those boulders! Looking back on it, we were very ill-prepared, hahaha. We know better now. Oh well, c'est la vie.

<br>
There were many break points where you can climb up and check out the view, and I have to say, they were absolutely awesome. We really lucked out during the journey up, as the clouds began to break up and the sun started shining through. Overcast days really make for the best picture taking.

We saw this dude throughout the trail, and little did we know how crazy he was. WHO WOULD DO A HANDSTAND ON THE EDGE OF A BOULDER?! We were all watching him, clenching our buttholes, while his group was yelling at him to stop being so freaking insane! I legit thought I was going to watch a man die that day.
<br><br>
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, we made it to the summit!

*Bless up*
<br>
It was extremely satisifying, to say the least. There really isn't much else to it! I'm extremely grateful that my friends let me join them on the hike. I will say that that group is a very close-knit family, and to be included in their activities felt like a huge privilege, lol. Sounds weird to say, and they'd probably think I'm stupid for saying it, but it's true.

Just look at those beautiful faces!

Here are some more shots from the summit. I got my 'Brenizer Method' on that day :D

Probably the most important tip when hiking or doing any outdoor activity: DRINK WATER!
<br><br>
So, that's the end right? Going down is the easiest bit! WRONG! We had two options: 1) Go back the way we came, or 2) Go down the "easier" way, but ultimately walking more miles than option 1. We went with the latter, and I kind of regret it, lol. We all did. If we had gone back the way we came, sure it would've meant climbing down the boulders and such again, but it would've been faster going down. Instead, what we thought would be a piece of cake, turned out to be a challenging path on its own. Going downhill seems easy enough, but to constantly go down a decline takes a huge toll on your legs; and in my case, my knees. We took many breaks at this point, haha.
<br>

At least some views were nice!
<br>
Despite the regretable choice, the hike came to an end. We even got to see a baby black bear! No, I didn't take a picture of it out of fear that it would get startled and call its mama bear. We know how that would end. All in all, it was an incredible hike, and one I highly recommend to everyone who loves the outdoors. Heck, even if you don't and you're looking for something challenging, this is the hike for you! Do go with friends who are experienced, though. I will not be held accountable if you go solo dolo and something happens to you :P 
<br><br>
To Gabe, Demi, Miggy, Elicea, Regina, James and Ara, thank you guys again for an awesome day! I'm genuinely happy that you all included me into your group activity, and I still find it hilarious you all decided that I was the reason this trip even happened, haha. You can blame me for all of the soreness the past two days. Y'all are the coolest!
