I've let myself go. For the past three years or so I have allowed myself to become almost as unfit as I was before I became a Beachbody Coach. I definitely wasn't happy about it but I had my reasons. Call them excuses if you like, but fitness hasn't been a priority for me for some time and that was a strange thing to come to terms with. I had spent so long focusing primarily on my own health and fitness and other people's too. Now, here I am once again, needing to take care of myself.

The most difficult of hurdles I've had to deal with has been my back. You see, I found out that I have compressed vertebrae and was lucky to have found it when I did. Unfortunately, this caused other issues in my back, around my hips, in my glutes, and many other things around my core. The most prominent of which was sharp pain and limited mobility. When things got bad, I limped everywhere I went. I dreaded getting in and out of my car because I knew that it would bring on a really sharp and intense pain. Waking up in the morning was a gamble. I either got out of bed without much trouble. Or, I would try to roll over and would immediately stiffen up from the pain. I tried a few times to workout through it and see if the activity would help but it didn't, and that was one of the most frustrating things I've ever experienced. Wanting to save myself so badly from becoming unhealthy and being physically unable to. I recall a few days when it had gotten so bad that I almost broke down and cried out of frustration just because I was trying to get in and out of the shower or put my socks on. This was not the me that I was used to.

Fast forward to today. I see a chiropractor and get acupuncture treatment every week. Thank God for an awesome health insurance benefit that allows me to do that. I'm now pretty much pain free except the occasional tightening up of some muscles here and there. Nowhere near what it used to be. But still, working out continued to elude me because I would always feel my back start to tighten up during the workouts and that would inevitably lead to the rest of the associated pains. However, this week has been different.
<br><br>
I made a decision. I decided that it was time to take my body back after the long, lovely vacation it's been on. I know what can be achieved by just changing my diet. But you see, for me, I make much better decisions about my diet when I'm consistenly working out. The two go hand-in-hand for me. If I'm not working out, I don't care too much about what I'm eating, and that's just the honest truth. But I knew that if I could just get myself back into some workouts, I would make the right choices and I could win some ground back. I may not ever get back to where I was a few years ago, but there's a whole lot of me that doesn't need to be around anymore. Enter, Insanity Max: 30.

Since my back was feeling great I thought I would go back to the one program that really inspired me and changed me to a level that nothing else truly had, Insanity. The combination of Shaun's encouragement and Dynasty Warrior-esque music just couldn't be beat. I actually like Insanity Asylum better but without much space and equipment, that was pretty much off the table. But, before kicking things off on Monday, I had a thought. I don't have a world of time for my workout but I still needed it to be effective. Then I remembered Max:30. I had never tried it but really wanted to and now I could just get it digitally and have immediate access to it, which wasn't an option before. So, I shifted gears and decided I would dive headfirst into Insanity Max: 30 instead.
<br><br>
I learned something about myself this week. So far, I've consistently worked out every day this week and that's a big milestone these days. Despite the soreness, the tightness, and the lack of endurance, I've stayed with it. This is such a milestone because I've tried sticking with old programs that I've already done but I could never do it. Being in the shape that I'm in now, I found myself constantly thinking "oh my God, how did it get to this point?" I was so busy remembering what I used to be capable of, how I used to perform, how fast I could go and how long I could last, that it became a big mental hurdle. A hurdle that discouraged me more that I understood because it lead me to think about the mountiain of a climb I was facing to get back to some semblance of fitness. But, while doing Insanity Max: 30, I discovered that I wasn't doing that. I couldn't. I've never done it before so I had no reference point. I had no memory of my performance. No bar had been set. This time, I was setting a new bar. I was pushing myself to my current limits and my best was my best. Period. It wasn't light years below what it used to be. It's the best that I've ever done in these workouts and I learned that for me, that has made all the difference.
<br><br>
I'm excited to get home and workout and do my level best to beat my time because I'm looking forward to progress and not a daunting task of chasing my old self down. This is a new journey, a new story. My mental game, much stronger. And, as I mentioned, I've managed to make good decisions with my diet all week because I'm actually fighting for my health. To top it all off, my back has held up superbly. So far so freaking good. I told my doctor and couldn't hide the silly grin on my face because I have hope again. There's light at the end of my tunnel and I'm going to get there one good meal, and one 30 minute workout at a time.
