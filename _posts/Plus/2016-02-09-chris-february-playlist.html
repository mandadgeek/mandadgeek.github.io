Every month I try to put together a new playlist on Soundcloud to give you a sense of the kind of music that moves me. You can always find them on my profile page <a href="/chris/">here</a>. This month, Feb. 2016, I'm feeling the disco vibe like never before. I would also like to make this a small tribute to the recently deceased Maurice White, co-founder of the timeless seminal band Earth, Wind and Fire, one of my all-time favorite bands. RIP Maurice, and thank you for the band and the music that shaped my childhood.
<br><br>
My monthly playlists are living playlists so I will continuall update them throughout the month with new songs that fit my fancy. You can also check out all of my older playlists on Soundcloud as well.
