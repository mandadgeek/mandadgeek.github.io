Today, my NRDy friends, I'm going to help you find a job! jk, I'm definitely not doing that. I wish I could include quotation marks in the title but I think that would break the way this whole blog backend works. "Build your resume" is something that I used to say to my friends when I was younger whenever they would be wrestling with the question, "why can't I find anyone?" I don't hear it as much anymore in my older years as people are actually finding their special someone and settling down. But, I think it's still good advice and figured it might be a good time to share it once again for anyone that might still be asking themselves that most haunting question.

I'll give you a little bit of background so you know where I'm coming from. I had my first official girlfriend in 6th grade. Throughout middle school and high school I was in many different relationships, both long and short, with people from many different backgrounds. Things started to slow down in college for the most part. I had to adult a lot more, of course, and take things more seriously so my relationships had a tendency to stretch out longer than before. Essentially, I didn't wrestle with this question very much and I think that's why people had a tendency to present it to me. Let me set the record straight though. I'm not mystifyingly handsome, clearly. I am pretty tall so I have that going for me, but that's probably it from a physical standpoint. So you know, I wasn't a girl magnet from a physical perspective. I wasn't in shape whatsoever when I was younger. I was just thin and lanky. I was a nice guy, one of the ones that they say tends to finish last. At least I think I was a nice guy lol. I'm sure I had my moments of being a jerk as well, plenty of them. I was also a weird combination of horrendously shy but very outgoing at the same time. I loved being involved with groups and helping things succeed. It was the little leader in me starting to spring up I suppose. But, I am also very introverted and quiet in many social situations. So, I'm not a social butterfly by any means.
<br><br>
Anyways. So what was I doing? I'll fill you in on my mentality and approach and hopefully it may help you in some way in your life. Maybe this is something you'll want to share with your own child one day. In any case, we all know that everyone's situation is unique so this obviously won't work for everyone. But, I still feel it's a sound approach to life in general.
<br><br>
First off, I never thought about it. I'm not going to tell you that I didn't have lonely heart-broken moments in my life, but I didn't often sit around dwelling on this question. I was too busy "building my resume" most of the time. By "building my resume" I mean I was  very focused on a particular interest or passion. There was breakdancing, there was singing, there was djing, there was my youth group, video games, etc. So many things came into my life that I poured myself into that I didn't really give myself the opportunity to mope. I was too busy to be lonely for too long.

It sounds so cliche but I highly recommend NOT looking for a special someone. Get engaged with things that you love and in that process you will encounter people that you will likely relate to and connect with. This is the reason why sometimes people and relationships will fall in and out of your life. They work for the season of life you're in, until they don't because your season or their season, or both, are changing. You know you've found your special someone when it's not the season of life that matters most, it's the person. I'm not the same person that my wife knew when we first met. My priorities are different. My habits are different. I'm not in shape. My passions have changed. Yet, she loves me still.
<br><br>
You want to build your life resume because the best thing you can offer another person is a mature understanding of yourself. We get so caught up in wanting to find a relationship and companionship that we focus on that pursuit and not the pursuit of a more complete comprehension of who WE are and what WE have to offer someone. You can usually tell when someone just wants a relationship because they tend to bring all manner of insecurities with them. Their personal value becomes tied to the relationship and not from within. If you don't value yourself, other people can and will certainly value you, but they can't value who you are for you and you don't want to force them to. It's hard enough holding up your own side of a relationship.
<br><br>
We are in an age where it's so easy to learn and be involved with things that you're interested in or passionate about. Just remember that your social media persona, and other people's personas, are rarely ever a complete picture of who they are. Don't let your "social" connections become the measure of your personal value. The number of people that like, watch, or follow what you do really doesn't say much in the end. What matters is your relationship with yourself. How much do you like yourself and who you are? How much of a fan are you of your own life? The age old leadership question is also important, "would you follow yourself?" 
<br><br>
The more you "build your resume" the more opportunities you have to learn about yourself. So, go out there and "build your resume." Discover who you are and what's important to you and I guarantee that you will become an infinitely more attractive and magnetic individual for doing so. And that, my NRDy friends, is typically when that special someone ends up finding you.
<br><br>
Stay NRDy my friends.
