Today, my NRDy friends, I'm going to help you find a job! jk, no I'm not. I wish I could include quotation marks in the title but I think that would break the way this whole blog backend works. "Build your resume" is something that I used to say to my friends when I was younger whenever they would be wrestling with the question, "why can't I find anyone?" I don't hear it as much anymore in my older years as people are actually finding their special someone and settling down. But, I think it's still good advice and figured it might be a good time to share it once again for anyone that might still be asking themselves that most haunting question.

I'll give you just a little bit of background so you know where I'm coming from. I had my first official girlfriend in 6th grade. throughout middle school and high school I was in many different relationships both long and short with people from many different backgrounds. Things started to slow down in college for the most part. I had to adult a lot more of course and take things more seriously so my relationships had a tendency to stretch out longer than before. In short, I didn't wrestle with this question very much and I think that's why people had a tendency to present it to me. Let me set the record straight though. I'm not mystifyingly handsome, clearly. I am pretty tall so I have that going for me, but that's probably it from a physical standpoint. So you know, I wasn't a girl magnet from a physical perspective. I wasn't in shape whatsoever when I was younger. I was just thin and lanky. I was a nice guy, one of the ones that they say tends to finish last. At least I think I was a nice guy lol. I'm sure I had my bad moments of being a jerk as well, plenty of them. I was also a weird combination of horrendously shy but very outgoing at the same time. I loved being involved with groups and helping things succeed. It was the little leader in me starting to spring up I suppose. But, I am also very introverted and quiet in many social situations. So I'm not a social butterfly by any means.
<br><br>
Anyways. So what was I doing? I'll fill you in on my mentality and approach and hopefully it may help you in some way in your life. Maybe this is something you'll want to share with your own child one day. In any case, we all know that everyone's situation is unique so this obviously won't work for everyone, but I still feel it's a sound approach to life in general.

First off, I never thought about it. I'm not going to tell you that I didn't have lonely heart-broken moments in my life, but I didn't often sit around dwelling on this question. I was too busy "building my resume" most of the time. By "building my resume" I mean I was usually very focused on a particular interest of passion. There was breakdancing, there was singing, there was djing, there was my youth group, video games, etc. So many things came into my life that I poured myself into that I didn't really give myself the opportunity to mope. I was too busy to be loney for too long.

Stay NRDy my friends.
