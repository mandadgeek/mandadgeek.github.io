<p>What could I tell you that would give you a little insight into who I am and why I am who I am? I'll try and keep it simple for you:</p>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>- I'm a Filipino American born in Houston, Texas and no I have not learned how to speak Tagalog</li><br><br>
  <li>- I'm married to my best friend and we are the proud parents of a Sharbrador named Kikko and a Welsh Corgi named Korree</li><br><br>
  <li>- I used to breakdance in high school and that's when I fell in love with old school hip-hop and dance music</li><br><br>
  <li>- I'm a choleric INFJ personality type, if that means anything to you :P</li><br><br>
  <li>- I've messed around as a DJ (house and UK garage when it was still a thing), nothing serious, but occassionaly still make house mixes</li><br><br>
  <li>- I was part of a Catholic youth group for half a dozen years</li><br><br>
  <li>- I love to sing and have been part of an a capella group. I was also sometimes part of the aforementioned youth group's music ministry.</li><br><br>
  <li>- I'm a Team Beachbody Coach for health, fitness, and leadership development but have been dormant for a few years. I've spent time with the great John Maxwell and my life has been forever changed for it.</li><br><br>
  <li>- I love video games and have gamed since owning an Intellivision when I was 5. Playing Burger Time is one of my earliest memories.</li><br><br>
  <li>- I played Dungeons and Dragons (and other pen and paper RPGs like Pathfinder) consistently every other week for about 3-4 years and dabbled in many others earlier in my life such as Rifts, Turtles, Legend of the Five Rings, and Macross. </li><br><br>
</ul>
<p>There's much more to know and I'm sure you'll see it here at NRDPLS. We're about showing people that we are all more than the first blush, so there's a quick snapshot of some of the stuff that makes me, well, me.
