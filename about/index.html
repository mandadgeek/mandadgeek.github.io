<h2>NRDPLS = Nerd Plus</h2>
 
<p>NRDPLS is two nerds who, like many you, are much more than just nerds. This site is about us and all of the nerdy things that we're passionate about: video games, anime, sci-fi, fiction, etc. But, it's also about the other aspects of life that we love to be deeply involved with: music, sports, personal development, health and fitness, family, and so much more.
<br><br>
Our goal is simply to provide you a window into our lives with the hope that we can add some value and entertainment to your life and vice versa. As much as we're excited to share our passions with you, we want to learn about you and what drives you too. We want to know what gets you all excited about your life. What are you passionate about? What can you talk about for hours on end, long before the last person in the room has stopped listening? What dominates your daydreams? What goals are you striving for? How are you growing and improving?
<br><br>
Welcome to NRDPLS! It's ok to be you, when you're around us.</p>
